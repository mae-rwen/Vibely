          <li>1. Creating a user profile</li>
          <p>The first step to using our website is to create your own user profile. To do this, click on the "Sign Up" button on the homepage and provide your name, email address, and password. Once you've completed the sign-up process, you'll be able to customize your profile by adding a profile picture and providing some basic information about yourself. This will help others get to know you better and find common interests.</p>
          <li>2. Browsing through categories and events</li>
          <p>After you've created your profile, you'll be able to browse through categories and events that are of interest to you. You can do this by clicking on the "Categories" tab on the homepage, where you'll see a list of different categories such as "Skill sharing", "Board Games", "Connect & Socialize", and more. Click on a category to view the events that are available.</p>
          <li>3. Finding an event of interest</li>
          <p>Once you've found a category that interests you, you can click on the event that catches your eye to view more information about it. Here, you'll be able to see the date, time, location, and a brief description of the event. You'll also be able to see who else has RSVP'd to the event, which will give you an idea of who you might meet and what to expect.</p>
          <li>4. Contacting the event's organizer and joining the event</li>
          <p>If you're interested in attending the event, you can click on the "Join" button to RSVP. This will let the event's organizer know that you're planning to attend. You'll also be able to send a message to the organizer to ask any questions you might have or to introduce yourself. This is a great way to connect with others before the event and make new friends.</p>
          <li>Creating your own events</li>
          <p>If you don't see an event that interests you, you can also create your own activity by clicking on the "Create new Event" button. Here, you'll be able to provide details about the activity you'd like to share with others, such as the date, time, location, and a brief description. Once you've created your event, others will be able to see it and RSVP if they're interested.</p>
  </ol>
  <p>We hope this guide has been helpful in getting started on our social networking website. Remember, this is a great way to meet new people, explore new interests, and share your passions with others. Happy vibing!</p>
